    In this page there will be a collection of statistics, metrics, and gath-
    ered data from the analysis of the current snapshot of the keyserver infras-
    tructure.

        <h1>Stats</h1>
          <h2>Ptree</h2>
          <!-- pippozzo -->
          <p>
            The ptree is basically a tree in which the arity is decided by the bitquantum parameter.
             It's important that the parameters are the same among all keyserver because the reconciliation algorithm will work only if the tree structure is the same for two servers.
           A tree is a widely used structure in computing because it allow faster insert, search and retrieval compared to linked lists as long as the tree is balanced.
          If the tree is unbalanced (up to the point that become totally flat) part of its effectiveness is lost.
          This analysis try to point out the current state of the ptree, by looking at its height, balance, leaf distribution and elements per leaf node so that we know if it is effective as it is designed to be.

          A tree is balanced only if for every intermediate node of the tree the following properties hold:
          <ul>
            <li> The left and right subtree heights differ by at most one. </li>
            <li> The left subtree is balanced </li>
            <li> The right subtree is balanced </li>
          </ul>
          Some tree structure implementation offer auto-balancing properties, but it is not the case for the ptree implementation. 
          The prefix tree originally used in SKS has been designed with the idea that hashsum (md5) of certificates would be equally distributed, since the output string of an hash function can be considered random.
           So with a clever implementation that would divide hashsums between nodes based on the corresponding numerical value, the tree should be always balanced.

    We analyzed the length of the certificates and in particular of the user attributes, to understand what users are including in their certificate, and to scan for uncommon user attributes dimensions which may cause issue to the keyservers network. 
    Several system administrator have pointed out issues during the recon process, which may be caused also by large keys being exchanged <a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    The following chart represent the length of the certificates in our database,
    divided in bins. Up to 10 Kb bins are small (1Kb), then gets progressively
    larger.
    Numbers are placed on the smaller part to highlight that, even if in a
    lower percentage, there are certificate of every possible size. It is easy to
    see that the concentration of certificates is higher in the lower bins, most
    certificates weight less than 3KB and this is a good news.
    There few big certificates, mostly because of the inclusion of images as
    user attribute. Some of this certificates could reach the dimension of some
    Megabytes, luckily they are rare.
    In particular about image user attributes, we need to wonder if it is really
    necessary for a keyserver to include such information of a public key. After
    all, images attached to a key cannot be validated, so even if it could be
    possible to know for sure that the subject of the picture is a real person, it
    would be impossible to prove the binding between the picture and the person
    in the picture and the identity.

        <p>
        DSA and Elgamal were more prevalent before 2003-04 when RSA keys
        started taking place quickly, maybe due to RSA being adopted as the default
        choice by GPG, due to being, at the time, the way to overcome old DSA 1024 bit limit, and 160-bit signature limit, and by SSH key generator utility <a href="#footnote-2">[3]</a>.
        While Elliptic Curve being considered the future of public key algorithms is
        still considerable in its infancy because its usages are rare: less than 1% of
        keys are generated by EC.
        </p>
        <h3>RSA</h3>
        <p>
        RSA public keys are the majority of the set. They account for almost
        50% of public keys.
        As of today standards keys created with a bits size of less than 2048 are
        not considered secure <a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a>. Until 1980s, key of 512 bits were recommended as
        sufficient security standard. Since many embedded devices did not provide
        enough processing power to have an efficient generation of larger keys even
        330 bits keys were used in the early 1980s. Academic successes in breaking
        those keys, led to a change in recommended key size, which would increase
        to 1024 during the 1990s.
        The chart represent the numbers of keys with the corresponding n parameter found. It is easy to see that since 2013 there was a shift to adopt
        more robust key sizes, and it is a positive news. However during the very
        last year is possible to see also a spike in the creation of weak keys.
        </p>
        <div class="chart pubkey-rsa">
        <!-- In depth RSA distribution per year -->
            <canvas name="pubkey-rsa">Canvas not working :(</canvas>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Elgamal</h3>
        <p>Elgamal public keys are almost the 26% of the set.</p>
        <div class="chart pubkey-elgamal">
        <!-- In depth Elgamal distribution per year -->
            <canvas name="pubkey-elgamal">Canvas not working :(</canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
        A 1024 bits length for p is no more secure and should not be used. Until
        2020/2030 a length of 2048 bits can still be considered secure, but after 2030
        should be used p with a length of at least 3072. The chart show that the
        trend in using Elgamal is declining
        </p>

        <h3>DSA</h3>
        <p>
        DSA public keys are almost the 25% of the set.
        </p>
        <div class="chart pubkey-dsa">
        <!-- In depth DSA distribution per year -->
            <canvas name="pubkey-dsa">Canvas not working :(</canvas>
        </div>
        <p>
        This graph is similar to the Elgamal one for the same reason. In the chart
        is presented a view of the two parameters of DSA, q and p which present
        the same trend. p is considered no longer secure with a length of 1024 bits
        or less, 2048 bits are needed to achieve a recommended level of security.
        </p>

        <h3>Elliptic Curve</h3>
        <p>Elliptic Curve keys are the least used, only 0.13% of the set.</p>
        <div class="chart pubkey-ec">
        <!-- In depth Elliptic Curve distribution per year -->
            <canvas name="pubkey-ec">Canvas not working :(</canvas>
        </div>
        <p> The elliptic curve algorithms in OpenPGP use some fixed curves, thus
        there is no need for plotting and check their size.</p>

        <h2>certificate vulnerability</h2>
        <p>
        Peaks is capable of scanning in a background job the whole set of public
        keys loaded to detect the common known vulnerabilities. This is an im-
        provement over the state of the art, which do not provide any feedback over
        inserted key material.
        The searched vulnerabilities are:
        <ul>
          <li>RSA Vulnerabilities</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Small key size</li>
            <li>Modulus is prim</li>
            <li>Modulus has common factor: the key has a common factor with
        another key, which greatly simplify the recovery of the other factor
        of both keys</li>
            <li>Modulus has low prime factor</li>
            <li>Exponent too small</li>
            <li>Roca vulnerability found</li>
            <li>Missing parameters: the key miss the core parameter to be eval-
              uated, probably caused by a broken key.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Elgamal and DSA</li>
          <ul>
            <li>P is not prime</li>
            <li>Q is not prime</li>
            <li>G equals to 1</li>
            <li>G wrong subgroup</li>
            <li>p - 1 is not a multiple of q</li>
            <li>Missing parameters</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Elliptic Curve Vulnerabilities</li>
          <ul>
            <li>algorithm doesn’t work on this curve</li>
            <li>pubkey doesn’t belong to the curve</li>
            <li>Missing parameters</li>
          </ul>
        Now will be presented the results from the analysis.
        Each algorithm results will be in its own section. The first chart of each
        section will be a comparison between the numbers of healthy and unhealthy
        keys, and then, an in depth view of the unhealthy keys will be provided.

    From the certificates loaded in peaks database, we were able to collect
    a lot of user identities inputs. Of such inputs, we found out that not all
    address where is the standard form (Name Surname (Optional comment)
    &lt;email address&gt;), so we need to filter the data to find what kind of data
    was stored.
    Even if a lot of public keys are actually left without an email address,
    we were able to collect a lot of domains used, with the purpose of test the
    availability, and actually we found a large number of unreachable hosts.
    As demonstration of the keyserver network usage and in general of OpenPGP
    software appliances we collected also evidences of public keys used to sign
    PPAs.
    A Personal Package Archive (PPA) is a special software repository for
    uploading source packages to be built and published as an APT repository
    by Launchpad, a web platform, developed and maintained by Canonical Ltd,
    that allows users to develop and maintain software, particularly open-source
    software. A developer which want to build open source software is required
    to create a key pair, used to sign created packages, so users could import
    the public key from a public keyserver and verify the authenticity of the
    software.
    Unfortunately we noted also an alarming trend in user inputs: there were
    a bunch of url, which we do not scan, but for sure some were magnet link
    to torrent files. This is the practical demonstration that keyserver needs
    to be proactively secured against malicious user inputs, which even if not
    damaging the keyserver infrastructure directly, could damage the image of
    the keyservers role in the OpenPGP ecosystem, and expose the network to
    several misuses.
